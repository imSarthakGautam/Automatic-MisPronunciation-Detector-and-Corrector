Each of the files in your `fine_tuned_model` directory serves a specific purpose for the functioning of fine-tuned model. 

### **File Breakdown**

1. **`vocab.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the vocabulary mapping of text tokens (characters or subwords) to numerical IDs.
   - **Importance**: Essential for text-to-ID conversion during input processing and decoding predictions.
   - **Import to Django**:  it ensures the input and output processing of your model aligns with the training vocabulary.

---

2. **`tokenizer_config.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Stores configuration settings for the tokenizer, such as type, special tokens, and decoding strategies.
   - **Importance**: Needed to properly initialize the tokenizer with the same settings used during fine-tuning.
   - **Import to Django**:  it ensures the tokenizer behaves the same way in production as during training.

---

3. **`special_tokens_map.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Maps special tokens (e.g., `[PAD]`, `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`) to their corresponding IDs in the vocabulary.
   - **Importance**: Critical if model uses these special tokens during input processing or output generation.
   - **Import to Django**: for consistent processing of special tokens.

---

4. **`preprocessor_config.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains preprocessing details (e.g., feature extraction, sampling rates) to prepare audio for the model.
   - **Importance**: Matches preprocessing conditions used during fine-tuning to ensure inputs are consistent.
   - **Import to Django**:  audio inputs need to be preprocessed identically.

---

5. **`config.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines the model's architecture and hyperparameters (e.g., hidden layers, attention heads).
   - **Importance**: Required for loading the model with the same architecture as the fine-tuned version.
   - **Import to Django**: to ensure the correct model configuration is restored.

---

6. **`added_tokens.json`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains any additional tokens that were added to the tokenizer during fine-tuning.
   - **Importance**: Used if new tokens were introduced (e.g., domain-specific vocabulary).
   - **Import to Django**: but only if custom tokens were added. If the file is empty or doesn't exist, it's not mandatory.

---

7. **`model.safetensors`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the fine-tuned model's weights in a lightweight and secure format.
   - **Importance**: This is the core of the model and is mandatory for inference.
   - **Import to Django**: as this contains the trained weights necessary for predictions.

---

### **Files to Import into Django**
You need the following files to run the model successfully in Django:
- `vocab.json`
- `tokenizer_config.json`
- `special_tokens_map.json`
- `preprocessor_config.json`
- `config.json`
- `model.safetensors`
- `added_tokens.json` (only if custom tokens are used)

These files should all be present in the model's directory when calling:
```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor

processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained(MODEL_DIR)
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(MODEL_DIR)
```

---

### **Why Do We Need All These Files?**
The combination of these files ensures:
1. **Consistency**: All preprocessing, tokenization, and model configurations match the training setup.
2. **Functionality**: Without these, the model won't know how to process inputs, generate outputs, or interpret them.
3. **Reusability**: By maintaining the structure, the model and processor can be reused in any environment.

If any of these files are missing, you risk:
- Input/output mismatches.
- Errors in tokenization or decoding.
- Improper model architecture loading.
